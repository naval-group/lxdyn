# lxdyn Contribution Integration Process

## Preamble

The purpose of this document is to describe the process for integrating new developments into the public GitHub repository of lxdyn.

By definition, developments carried out on the **simulation core** must not be of a sensitive nature and must therefore be shareable with all roles defined in this document, as the simulation core is **open source under the EPL 2.0 license**.

### Out of scope (to be addressed later)

The following elements are not covered by this document and will be the subject of dedicated studies:

- code testing and validation processes,

- management process for sensitive models and algorithms,

- support process via `lotusim_support@naval-group.com`.

## Glossary

- **NGSA**: Naval Group SA parent company.

- **Project Team**: LOTUSim team composed of NGSA employees and its subsidiaries (including Centers of Expertise and Sirehna), carrying out developments on the **Private Repository**.

- **Private Repository**: private GitLab repository hosted by the external Digital Factory, containing all developments carried out and integrated by the Project Team.

- **Public Repository**: public GitHub repository accessible to the entire open source community and maintained by the Project Team.

## Overall Organization

lxdyn developments are coordinated by the LOTUSim Project Team, which interacts with the open source community through:

- the public GitHub repository,

- the support email address `lotusim_support@naval-group.com`,

- monthly newsletters.

The **Project Team** works according to an agile methodology inspired by the **Scrum Guide (November 2020)**:

- daily meetings are replaced by weekly meetings,

- sprint duration is set to **4 weeks**.

The branch management strategy for both repositories follows the best practices recommended by the **GitFlow workflow**:

## Roles

### Product Owner (internal)

- Key interface between users and developers.

- Defines functional requirements and priority features

- Ensures overall project consistency.

- Primary point of contact for external users via `lotusim_support@naval-group.com`.

### Contributor (external)

- Open source contributor or partner using and modifying the software.

- Originator of requirements through the submission of `Issue` on the **Public repository**.

- Develops contributions on their own `Fork` of the project.

### Maintainer (internal)

- Developer with full access rights to the **Private repository**.

- Distributed across NGSA and its subsidiaries.

- Carries out developments defined during sprint plannings.

- Manages the integration of open source contributions.

#### Scrum Master (internal)

- Organizes and moderates Scrum meetings in line with the Product Owner's roadmap.

- Assists the maintainers in meeting their delivery goals.

- Identifies and helps remove blockers that impact the maintainers.

#### Project Maintainer (internal)

Among the maintainers, the **Project Maintainer**:

- has final responsibility for validating `Merge Request`,

- ensures overall technical and architectural consistency of the project.

As lxdyn evolves, **maintainers by functional scope** may be appointed under the coordination of the **Project Maintainer**.

## Feature Development Process by the Project Team

### Hotfix

Urgent correction of a critical malfunction affecting the stability, execution, or integrity of the simulation core results.

#### Process

- Priority assignment to a maintainer, including during an ongoing sprint.

- Integration via a dedicated `Merge Request`.

- Final validation by the Project Maintainer.

### Bug

Correction of an identified malfunction in an existing feature whose impact is not blocking and can be handled within the normal sprint cycle.

#### Process

- Logged as an Issue.

- Prioritized by the Project Team during sprint planning.

- Fixed within the normal sprint cycle.

- Integration via a dedicated `Merge Request`.

- Final validation by the **Project Maintainer**.

### Contribution

Non-corrective development intended to enhance lxdyn, including the addition of new features, new models, functional or technical improvements, performance optimizations, or data contributions.

#### Process

- During sprint planning, the **Product Owner** presents the **Sprint Objective**.

- This objective is broken down by the **Scrum Master** into **Backlog Items** and assigned to the **Project Team**.

- Items are decomposed into technical contributions assigned to **Maintainers**.

- Integration via a dedicated `Merge Request`.

- Final validation by the **Project Maintainer**.

### Sensitive Contributions

- Process to be defined.

## Feature Integration Process by the Open Source Community

The detailed process is described in the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file of the **Public Repository**.

Main steps:

1. The contributor formalizes their proposal through an `Issue` on the **Public Repository**.

2. The contributor forks the project and implements the proposed changes.

3. The contributor submits a `Merge Request`.

The **Project Team** commits to providing a reasoned response within one month.
The evaluation may take place during weekly meetings, sprint plannings, or sprint reviews.

### Merge Request Validation Criteria

A Merge Request must:

- ensure the quality and consistency of lxdyn releases,

- benefit the entire partner ecosystem,

- be sufficiently generic,

- comply with the project’s minimum standards.

In case of disagreement within the Project Team, the decision is escalated to the **Technical Committee**, and then to the **Strategic Committee**, in accordance with the LOTUSim governance process.
