# Checks forces and torques are outputted in the right frame.
#
# The resistance curve force in issue_202.yml is defined at the hydrodynamic
# forces calculation point in body frame. This point is at the origin of the
# BODY frame and the centre of inertia is at (0,0,1). Fy, Fz, Mx, My & Mz
# should all be 0. Issue 202 was created because My was 1 (that is M = r x F
# with r the vector between COG and O (that is (0, 0, -1) and F the resistance
# force (that is (-1, 0, 0)). This meant that the forces were expressed in the
# COG reference frame, not in the body reference frame.
